# Ilana-Mahmea's Personal Homepage

**Author:** [Ilana-Mahmea Siegel](https://github.com/m-siegel/)

This is a simple HTTP/CSS/JS page built with Bootstrap. It's a typical personal website, providing some information about my career path, experience, skills, projects and hobbies.

I created this site as part of my [Northeastern University CS5610 Web Development](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_fall_2022/) class in fall 2022.

My **objectives** were

- To become familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript through hands-on practice and experimentation, and
- To create a personal website that I can link to for both personal and professional use.
  <!-- Great concise decription for each technologies used -->

  I used the following **technologies**:

- _Figma_ – for planning and page mock-ups.
- _HTML_ – for site and page structure.
- _CSS_ – for page styling (primarily color choice).
- _Bootstrap_ – for page styling (responsive grid, tabs, carousel, cards, etc.).
- _JavaScript_ – for the typing effect on the landing page.
